# My Portfolio

#### _Created my own personal web page 08.26.2016_

#### By Michael Poehner

## Description

This webpage represents me and my experiences in my life. It has a little bio of me what I have done in the past for employment, my goals for the future, why I am taking a programming course, my travels along the way, languages I speak, and links to some of my git hub projects in this course. This is my second time submitting this project, but with many enhancements. I have taken some time to make sure everything is neat and clean, and added several photos and organized them in containers.
