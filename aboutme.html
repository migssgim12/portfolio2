        <p class="text1">Living in Quebec, France, and the US has expanded my awareness of people, culture and the way of the world. Being trilingual in French Spanish and English has also has given me an advantage over other travellers of the world. I graduated from Middlebury college with a Masters in French. After the Masters program, I taught French and Spanish for a few years. After teaching, I entered into the corportate sector for a few years. Then I travelled for a little while and did some volunteer work. Now I find myself here in Oregon, learning how to program and enjoying the beautiful unique city of Portland.</p>
