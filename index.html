        <p>This webpage is to help you understand who I am and my path in life. I am an international player who recently moved to <span class="portland"><a href="https://www.travelportland.com/">Portland</a></span> to reunite with lost friends, write about my experiences with my travels and revelations about the human experience on the way.</p>

        <p>I am really excited to be a part of the <a href="http://www.epicodus.com/"><strong>Epicodus</strong></a> family. Although their curriculum can seem very intense and frustrating, I know that in the end if I stick with it I will greatly improve my coding skills. Not only does programming facilitate learning of other technologies, but after coding and solving problems you increase your ability to think logically and clearly. Upon my arrival to Portland, I tried to study coding on my own. It is challenging to learn a new subject on your own, and the lack of structure and direction provoked me to seek schools within which I can grow and become competent and invaluable to the tech industry of today.</p>
